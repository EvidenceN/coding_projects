In Python, `asyncio` is the built-in library used to write asynchronous programs, which allows you to handle tasks concurrently, meaning multiple tasks can run independently without blocking each other. Here's a basic explanation and examples of how to use asynchronous programming with `asyncio`.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Coroutines**: These are special functions that can be paused and resumed. You define them using the `async def` syntax.
2. **`await`**: You use `await` to call another coroutine. This tells Python to "pause" the execution of the current coroutine and wait for the result of the awaited coroutine.
3. **Event Loop**: The event loop runs asynchronous tasks and handles their execution.
4. **Tasks**: These are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

### Basic Example: 

```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate an I/O operation using sleep
    print("Hello again after 1 second!")

async def main():
    print("Start")
    await say_hello()  # Await a coroutine
    print("End")

# Python 3.7+
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Running Multiple Tasks Concurrently:
If you want to run multiple asynchronous functions concurrently, you can use `asyncio.gather()`.

```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Hello again after 2 seconds!")

async def say_goodbye():
    print("Goodbye!")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Goodbye again after 1 second!")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(say_hello(), say_goodbye())

asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, `say_hello` and `say_goodbye` run concurrently. Even though `say_hello` takes 2 seconds, both tasks are executed together, so the total time to complete both tasks is 2 seconds instead of 3.

### Creating and Managing Tasks:
Tasks allow you to run coroutines concurrently. You can create them with `asyncio.create_task()`.

```python
import asyncio

async def task_1():
    print("Task 1 running")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Task 1 complete")

async def task_2():
    print("Task 2 running")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Task 2 complete")

async def main():
    t1 = asyncio.create_task(task_1())
    t2 = asyncio.create_task(task_2())
    
    # Wait until both tasks are completed
    await t1
    await t2

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Points to Keep in Mind:
- Use `async def` to declare a coroutine function.
- Use `await` to call and wait for the result of another coroutine.
- You need an event loop to run asynchronous code, and `asyncio.run()` is a simple way to start the loop.
- `asyncio.gather()` or `asyncio.create_task()` can be used to run multiple coroutines concurrently.
