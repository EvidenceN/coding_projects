Explanation why this is wrong

When you run privateExample.py, the ledger files it creates are inaccurate because we modified the _balance and _name outside the class, which resulted in invalid states. AliceLedger.txt inexplicably has a lot of money in it:

Balance is 0
Deposit 120
Balance is 120
Withdraw 40
Balance is 80
Withdraw 1000
Balance is 999999000

Now thereâ€™s a BobLedger.txt file with an inexplicable account balance, even though we never created a BankAccount object for Bob:

Withdraw 1000
Balance is 999998000
